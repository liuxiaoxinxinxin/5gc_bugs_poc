Wrong security header type for PDU Session Establishment Request

OAI5G v2.0.0
The PDU session establishment request is using the wrong security header type.
The current used header is : "Integrity protected and ciphered with new 5G NAS security context". However, according to TS 24.501, Table 9.3.1, this header can only be used by the "Security mode complete" procedure.
Hence, the new security header type shall be "Integrity protected and ciphered", which will use the security context generated during the "Security mode complete".

This problem has been first discovered by Alexis Falempin and confirmed in:
